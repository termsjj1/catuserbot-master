# ðŸ“„ Version 3.0.0

## New Features

* Added fast telethon support to improve download and upload speeds for files
* New help menu inspired by Userge, allowing users to get help for a specific command rather than the whole plugin
* Notification feature to alert users after a restart or update (enabled with `.notify on`)
* PM permit feature can be enabled with `.pmguard on/off` instead of using `PRIVATE_GROUP_IDvar`. However, users must set `PRIVATE_GROUP_BOT_API_ID`
* Custom PM text and picture variables have been removed; users must now use the `custom` command to set these. A custom block message has also been added.

## New Bot Commands

* `/uinfo`: reply this to a forwarded message to get details about the user who sent it (as stickers and emoji forwarded messages don't show who sent them)
* `/broadcast`: reply to any message in the bot PM to send it to all users who started the bot
* `/ban reason`: reply to a forwarded message in the bot to ban the user so that messages sent by them to the bot don't get forwarded to you
* `/unban reason`: reply to a user's forwarded message or give their username along with the command in the bot PM to unban them from your bot

## Bot Controls

* `bot_users`: to get a list of users who started your bot
* `bblist`: to get a list of banned users in the bot
* `bot_antif`: to turn anti-flood on or off in the bot PM (off by default)

## iytdl

* `iytdl`: to download YouTube videos in a specific format. This command shows you the list of all available formats, and you can download a specific format.
